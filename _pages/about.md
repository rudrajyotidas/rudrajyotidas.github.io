Thank you for visiting my webpage! I am Rudrajyoti Das. My friends (and those who find it difficult to pronounce my big name) call me Rudra. I am a final year student enrolled in a five-year dual degree program in Materials Engineering at the esteemed Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur. I am very passionate about soft robotics and stretchable electronics. I have spent a lot of time with 3D printers (FDM and SLA) and laser cutters and got my hands dirty with Ecoflex as well. During my free time, I like to watch and play football. I am a big Barcelona fan, and I try not to miss watching any game.

Currently, I am working on the development of underwater soft swimming robots actuated by electrohydraulic (EHD) pumps at The University of Electro-Communications, as a semester away exchange student under the supervision of Prof. Jun Shintake.

What is soft robotics?
======

I get this question whenever I talk about my research interests. Soft robotics is an exciting field that focuses on creating robots made out of soft and squishy materials, unlike traditional robots built from rigid materials. These robots can bend, stretch, and twist, making them incredibly versatile and able to handle delicate tasks that rigid robots cannot. This also makes it much easier to mimick the organic movements of living creatures. Since their bodies are inherently easily deformable, soft robots inherently offer safer interactions with its environment. This also provides them with huge potential to be used as medical devices.

If you want to know more about the research in this field, feel free to check out my blog where I have summarised some of the papers that I find really interesting!
