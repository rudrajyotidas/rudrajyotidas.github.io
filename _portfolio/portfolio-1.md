This is a continuum robotic manipulator inspired from the work of Continuum Robotics Lab (CRL). The continuum robot has spacer discs floating along its backbone. Each spacer disc has a Neodymium magnet which maintains the spacing. A set of six wires (or tendons) are routed through the discs. Pulling any of these wires at the base allows us to deform the backbone. Three of the tendons are terminated at the middle, so that the anterior half of the continuum robot can be controlled independent of the posterior half.

The continuum robot is made out of completely off-the-shelf materials (except the magnets). A bowden tube taken from a bicycle brake serves as the backbone for the posterior half while the brake wire is used as the backbone for the anterior half. Strings used in badminton rackets are used as tendons. The tendons are actuated by six stepper motors at the base of the manipulator.
