The soft pneumatic actuator that behaves like the body of a fish when inflated was made out of Ecoflex 00-30. The fish is made out of three parts. One middle section separating two air chambers. The middle section is made out of a strip of paper dipped in a silicone mold to act as the strain limiting layer. Depending on which chamber we inflate, the actuator bends on the opposite side. The molds were 3D printed in an Ultimaker S3 with ABS.

The fish actuator can show siginificant deformation at a pressure as low as 3 kPa, and bends by around 45 degrees at 5 kPa. [In this video you can see the deformation with respect to pressure (0.1 V equals 1 kPa).](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1eQE0xkAif4GYj6oZD5JLq-73Iq-HfeaK/view?usp=drive_link)
